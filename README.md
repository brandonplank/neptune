# Neptune

Neptune was a checkout system that I developed my senior year in high school, The code was made to reduce the time it took to actually leave the classroom to go to the restroom, or anywhere during class. It made the process of signing your name, and putting the time and day an instant process via QR codes. All database credentials have been omitted since the open source.
